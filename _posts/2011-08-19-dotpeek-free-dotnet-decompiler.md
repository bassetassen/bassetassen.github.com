Ever wondered what the .Net framework looked like or had the need to look into someone else's code? Then dotPeek from Jetbrains is the thing for you.

dotPeek decompiles any .Net assembly, from the old 1.0 to 4.0. The decompiled assembly is categorized in namespaces and all the code is shown in C#. You can browse your hard drives for assemblies to look at or have a look at those in the GAC.

Easy navigating, familiar shortcut keys and syntax highlighting that all remind you of Visual Studio.

There are others decompilers for .Net as well, IL Disassembler comes with the .Net SDK, but it only show you the IL code as the name suggests. Another one and probably the most known decompiler is .Net Reflector from Redgate. Its not free, but the professional editions come with Visual Studio integration, possibility to debug assemblies you don’t even have the source code too and much more. There is also a bunch of other decompilers out there, but I don’t have any experience with any other then the three that I have mentioned.

For me it is not very often I have the use for a decompiler, but when there is a situation you need too look into an assembly you don’t have the source code too, they are great. I had one of those moments this week and dotPeek came along and saved the day. Thank you =)
