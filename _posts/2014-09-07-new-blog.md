I have planned for a long time now to change blog platform, this weekend I finally got around to it. My choice for blog platform is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Jekyll bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/). The blog is now hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). I have changed the default design form Jekyll bootstrap a bit, but it is still pretty plain and I guess that reflects my design skills :)

Now I just have to start blogging on a more regular basis.
